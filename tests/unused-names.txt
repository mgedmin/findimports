Listing unused imports
======================

Let's copy the sample tree to the temporary directory used for the tests,
so we can see short relative pathnames.

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.copytree(sample_tree, 'sample-tree')

Passing '-u' to findimports will give a list of unused import statements,
formatted in the traditional Unix compiler style

    >>> from findimports import main
    >>> exitcode = main(['findimports', '-u', 'sample-tree'])
    sample-tree/box/cat.py:1: gc not used

    >>> exitcode
    0


Getting rid of warnings
-----------------------

Sometimes you want to explicitly disable a warning (e.g. when the name is
imported solely for the purpose of being re-exported).  Simply place a
comment on that line of code to suppress the warning:

    >>> open('sample-tree/unused.py', 'w').write('''
    ... import re # unused, but this comment makes findimports ignore that
    ... ''')

    >>> exitcode = main(['findimports', '-u', 'sample-tree'])
    sample-tree/box/cat.py:1: gc not used

If you want to see that warning, pass '-a' in addition to '-u'

    >>> exitcode = main(['findimports', '-u', '-a', 'sample-tree'])
    sample-tree/box/cat.py:1: gc not used
    sample-tree/unused.py:2: re not used


Duplicate imports
-----------------

You can also ask for warnings about duplicate imports

    >>> exitcode = main(['findimports', '-u', 'sample-tree', '--duplicate'])
    sample-tree/apple.py:4: sys imported again
    sample-tree/box/cat.py:1: gc not used

or with extra verbosity

    >>> exitcode = main(['findimports', '-u', '--duplicate', '-v',
    ...                  'sample-tree'])
    sample-tree/apple.py:4: sys imported again
    sample-tree/apple.py:2:   (location of previous import)
    sample-tree/box/cat.py:1: gc not used
